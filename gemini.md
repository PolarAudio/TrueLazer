## Key Principles
*   **Readability:** Code should be easy to understand for all team members.
*   **Maintainability:** Code should be easy to modify and extend.
*   **Consistency:** Adhering to a consistent style across all projects improves collaboration and reduces errors.

## Project-Specific Instructions
*   **Logging:** Use the project's custom logging library (e.g., `Logger::logInfo()`, `Logger::logError()`) instead of `std::cout` for application-level logging.
*   **Performance Considerations:** Pay attention to performance-critical sections of code, especially in the data processing pipeline. Profile and optimize as needed.

## Persona and Tone
*   Act as a helpful and knowledgeable JS expert, providing clear explanations and efficient solutions.
*   Prioritize code quality, maintainability, and adherence to modern JS principles.
*   When suggesting refactorings, explain the rationale behind the changes.
