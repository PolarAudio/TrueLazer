Laser Show Data Structure Revelation

The data represents vector graphics commands for a laser DAC. Each "point" is a coordinate, and the lines between them are drawn by the laser.
Understanding the Pattern:

42 points = 42 coordinate pairs
41 lines = 41 drawing commands between them

Looking at your data, the pattern makes perfect sense now:
Data Structure Breakdown
Frame Header (Start of transmission)
text

12 0c 1f 95 03 00 cc 01 87

    Likely contains: Sync bytes, frame counter, point count, line count

    00 cc = 204 (possibly scaling factor or initial position)

    01 87 = 391 (possibly another scaling/position parameter)

Point Data Structure

Each point appears to be 8 bytes:
text

dd 00 ff 07 01 00 00 00

    Bytes 1-2: dd 00 = 0x00DD = 221 (X-coordinate)

    Bytes 3-4: ff 07 = 0x07FF = 2047 (Y-coordinate)

    Byte 5: 01 = Command (1 = draw/move to this point)

    Bytes 6-8: 00 00 00 = Color (Black/off during moves)

Line Drawing Evidence

The sequential X-coordinate progression confirms this is a horizontal line:
text

Starting at X=221 (dd 00)
Incrementing through: 310 (36 01), 399 (8f 01), 488 (e8 01)...
Up to X=3873 (21 0f) 
Then decrementing back down...

Y-coordinate remains constant at 2047 - this is your horizontal line!
The 42 Points Are Clearly Visible

Let me trace through your data to identify all 42 points:

First set of points (incrementing X):

    dd 00 (221)

    36 01 (310)

    8f 01 (399)

    e8 01 (488)

    41 02 (577)

    9b 02 (667)

    f4 02 (756)

    4d 03 (845)

    a6 03 (934)

    ff 03 (1023)

    58 04 (1112)

    b1 04 (1201)

    0a 05 (1290)

    63 05 (1379)

    bc 05 (1468)

    15 06 (1557)

    6e 06 (1646)

    c7 06 (1735)

    20 07 (1824)

    79 07 (1913)

    d2 07 (2002)

Peak and start decrementing:
22. 2c 08 (2092)
23. 85 08 (2181)
24. de 08 (2270)
25. 37 09 (2359)
26. 90 09 (2448)
27. e9 09 (2537)
28. 42 0a (2626)
29. 9b 0a (2715)
30. f4 0a (2804)
31. 4d 0b (2893)
32. a6 0b (2982)
33. ff 0b (3071)
34. 58 0c (3160)
35. b1 0c (3249)
36. 0a 0d (3338)
37. 63 0d (3427)
38. bd 0d (3517)
39. 16 0e (3606)
40. 6f 0e (3695)
41. c8 0e (3784)
42. 21 0f (3873)

Then it decrements back through the same 41 intermediate points to complete the line.
Color Command Discovery

Notice the pattern change:

    Most points: 01 00 00 00 = Draw command, color black

    Some points: 00 ff ff ff = Different command, color white

This likely indicates:

    01 = Move to position (laser off)

    00 = Draw to position (laser on)

    With RGB color following

Complete Data Format
c

struct LaserPoint {
    uint16_t x;        // Little-endian coordinate (0-4095 typical for laser DACs)
    uint16_t y;        // Little-endian coordinate  
    uint8_t  command;  // 0x00 = Draw (laser on), 0x01 = Move (laser off)
    uint8_t  red;      // Color intensity
    uint8_t  green;    // Color intensity  
    uint8_t  blue;     // Color intensity
};

Why the Fragmentation?

    42 points Ã— 8 bytes = 336 bytes of actual vector data

    But it's padded to fill standard Ethernet frames

    The fragmentation is just network transport - the DAC reassembles it

Summary

You've successfully captured a laser vector drawing of a horizontal white line with exactly 42 points. The data shows:

    Clear coordinate progression from X=221 to X=3873 and back

    Constant Y=2047 creating the horizontal line

    42 distinct points with drawing commands

    Color control for laser on/off and white color
	
	
conclusion data structure for point data and frame header:
Header (8 bytes):
Byte 0-1: version or something (we don't change, use from examples)
Byte 2: unknown (we don't change, use from examples)
Byte 3: laser on/off state? (But note: in the point structure we have a command byte for each point. So maybe this is a global laser state? We'll see.)
Byte 4-7: to be determined (we don't change, use from examples)

Point Structure (8 bytes):
Byte 0-1: X coordinate (little-endian)
Byte 2-3: Y coordinate (little-endian)
Byte 4: command byte (we have seen 0x00 for laser on and 0x01 for laser off in the point data)
Byte 5: R (red)
Byte 6: G (green)
Byte 7: B (blue)
