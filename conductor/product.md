# Product Definition: TrueLazer

## Initial Concept
TrueLazer is an ambitious source-available project aiming to create a powerful and flexible laser show control software, drawing inspiration from the intuitive workflow and extensive features of Resolume Arena. Built with JavaScript, TrueLazer is designed to provide artists and technicians with a versatile tool for live ILDA mixing, generative content, and advanced laser projection.

## Target Audience
The primary users are event technicians and lighting designers who are looking for a Resolume-like workflow for laser control. These users value familiarity, ease of use, and professional integration capabilities.

## Goals
The immediate focus for the next development phase is the stabilization and optimization of the NDI integration. This is critical to ensure that real-time laser rendering from NDI sources is performant and reliable enough for professional use.

## Core Features
- **Professional Integration:** High priority is placed on robust MIDI, OSC, and DMX/Artnet mapping. This allows users to control the software seamlessly using external hardware and existing show control systems.
- **Resolume-Inspired UI:** A familiar deck-based layout with layers and columns, tailored for ILDA content.
- **DAC Communication:** Seamless integration with IDN and EtherDream DACs for high-performance laser output.
- **Generative & Effects System:** A growing library of shape generators and real-time effects for dynamic visual creation.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **High Stability & Low Latency:** Essential for real-time laser rendering where timing is critical.
- **Low Resource Overhead:** The software must run smoothly on standard show laptops without excessive CPU or GPU strain.
- **Resilient Communication:** Ensuring rock-solid connectivity with DAC hardware to prevent any interruptions during live performances.
