# Product Guidelines: TrueLazer

## Brand Personality & Tone
TrueLazer positions itself as a **Professional & Reliable** tool for the demanding environment of live performances. It balances this with an **Innovative & Creative** spirit, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with generative laser visuals. As a **Accessible & Community-Driven** project, it maintains an open and collaborative atmosphere for its users and contributors.

## Visual Identity & UI Principles
- **Dark & High-Contrast:** The interface is designed for high visibility in dark environments typical of live shows (FOH). This minimizes eye strain and ensures that critical information and controls are always clear.
- **Informative & Visual:** The UI prioritizes real-time feedback. Integrated previews and clear status indicators provide users with immediate confidence in what is being output to the lasers.

## Communication & Terminology
- **Industry Standard:** We use precise technical terminology familiar to laser professionals and lighting designers (e.g., ILDA, DAC, PPS, Blanking). This ensures clarity and reduces ambiguity in professional workflows.
- **Performance-Oriented:** Documentation and internal messaging should consistently highlight the software's speed, efficiency, and rock-solid reliability, reinforcing the user's trust in the tool.
